# Advanced Configuration

Use these options when you need more control over providers, policies, and integrations. For a quick start, see [Config basics](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic).

For background on project guidance, reusable capabilities, custom slash commands, subagent workflows, and integrations, see [Customization](https://developers.openai.com/codex/concepts/customization). For configuration keys, see [Configuration Reference](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference).

## Profiles

Profiles let you save named configuration layers and switch between them from
the CLI. When you pass `--profile profile-name`, Codex loads
`~/.codex/config.toml`, then overlays `~/.codex/profile-name.config.toml`.
Profile names can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.

Create a separate TOML file for each profile. Use top-level config keys in the
profile file; don't nest them under `[profiles.profile-name]`.

```toml
# ~/.codex/deep-review.config.toml
model = "gpt-5.5"
model_reasoning_effort = "xhigh"
approval_policy = "on-request"
model_catalog_json = "/Users/me/.codex/model-catalogs/deep-review.json"
```

```shell
codex --profile deep-review
codex exec --profile deep-review "review this change"
```

Because the profile file is a layer above your base user config and below
project and CLI config, it only needs the values that differ from your base
config. Profile files can also override `model_catalog_json`; Codex uses the
profile value when both files set it.

In Codex 0.134.0 and later, `--profile` no longer reads `[profiles.profile-name]`
from `config.toml`, and the top-level `profile = "profile-name"` selector is no
longer supported. Move legacy profile settings into
`~/.codex/profile-name.config.toml`, then remove the matching
`[profiles.profile-name]` table and `profile = "profile-name"` selector from
`config.toml`.

## One-off overrides from the CLI

In addition to editing `~/.codex/config.toml`, you can override configuration for a single run from the CLI:

- Prefer dedicated flags when they exist (for example, `--model`).
- Use `-c` / `--config` when you need to override an arbitrary key.

Examples:

```shell
