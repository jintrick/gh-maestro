Using our authoring agent is an effective way to create, debug, optimize your agentic workflows.
This is a continuation of the [Create Agentic Workflows](/gh-aw/setup/creating-workflows/) page.

## Configuring Your Repository

In order to enable the agentic authoring experience, you will need to configure your repository with a few files. Run this prompt or the `init` command.

```text wrap
Initialize this repository for GitHub Agentic Workflows using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/install.md
```
or
```
gh aw init
```

Make sure to commit and push the files to your repository.

## Using the GitHub Web Interface

**If you have access to GitHub Copilot**, you can create and edit Agentic Workflows directly from the web interface. While non-interactive, it's useful for quickly turning an idea into a working workflow. For a more interactive experience, use a coding agent (see below).

/>

> [!TIP]
> On the first run in a new repository, the workflow will surely fail because the secrets are not configured.
> The agentic workflow should detect the missing tokens and create an issue with instructions on how to configure them.

## Remixing Workflows Between Repositories

When you need to adapt an existing workflow from another repository, use the `create-agentic-agent` to perform AI-assisted migration. The agent analyzes the source workflow, identifies dependencies, adapts configuration for your repository, and validates the result. This is useful for forking workflows as starting points or one-time migrations requiring substantial changes. For synchronized updates across repositories, use [Reusing Workflows](/gh-aw/guides/reusing-workflows/) with `gh aw add` instead.

Example prompt for migration:
```text wrap
Migrate the release.md workflow from github/gh-aw to this repository.
Adapt permissions and repository-specific references for our structure.
```

## Debugging Workflows

Use the `agentic-workflows` skill to diagnose and fix failing workflow runs.

### Through Copilot

If your repository is [configured for agentic authoring](#configuring-your-repository), use the `agentic-workflows` skill in Copilot Chat:

```text wrap
agentic-workflows debug https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/RUN_ID
```

The coding agent audits the run, identifies the root cause (missing tools, permission errors, network blocks), and suggests targeted fixes.

> [!TIP]
> Copy this prompt, replace `OWNER`, `REPO`, and `RUN_ID` with your values, and paste it into Copilot Chat. You can find the run URL on the GitHub Actions run page.

### Self-Contained (with URL)

For any AI assistant or coding agent, share the URL to the standalone debugging prompt:

```text wrap
Debug this workflow run using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/debug.md

The failed workflow run is at https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/RUN_ID
```

<CopyEntireFileButton filePath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/debug.md" label="Copy debug instructions" />

The `debug.md` file is a self-contained prompt. The agent fetches it and follows the instructions to install the `gh aw` CLI, analyze logs, apply fixes, and open a pull request with the changes.

## Authoring for Self-Hosted Runners

When you ask the authoring agent to target a self-hosted runner, it keeps the generated workflow compatible with self-hosted constraints. It sets `runs-on` to the runner your setup provides and routes the framework jobs there with `runs-on-slim`, declares the outbound domains the workflow needs under `network.allowed`, writes transient state to `$RUNNER_TEMP` instead of hardcoded paths, and avoids assuming root or installing to shared system paths. For GitHub Enterprise Server it enables GHES compatibility so the generated workflow uses artifact action versions that work there.

Example prompt:
```text wrap
Create a workflow that triages new issues and have it run on our self-hosted runners (runs-on: self-hosted).
```

You still own the runner-side setup (Docker, network egress, GHES endpoint). See [Self-Hosted Runners](/gh-aw/reference/self-hosted-runners/) for the full set of requirements.

## Advanced Techniques

### Planner

If you prefer to use an AI chatbot to author agentic workflows, use the [agentic-chat instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/.github/aw/agentic-chat.md) with any conversational AI to create clear, actionable task descriptions. <CopyEntireFileButton filePath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/.github/aw/agentic-chat.md" label="Copy agentic-chat instructions" />

Copy the instructions, paste into your AI chat, then describe your workflow goal. The assistant asks clarifying questions and generates a structured task description (wrapped in 5 backticks) ready to use in your workflow. It focuses on what needs to be done rather than how, making it ideal for creating specifications that coding agents can execute.

### Dictation

When creating agentic workflows using speech-to-text, use the [dictation instructions prompt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/DICTATION.md) to correct terminology mismatches and formatting issues. <CopyEntireFileButton filePath="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gh-aw/main/DICTATION.md" label="Copy dictation instructions" />

This prompt corrects terminology (e.g., "ghaw" → "gh-aw", "work flow" → "workflow"), transforms casual speech into imperative task descriptions, removes filler words, and adds implicit context. Load it into your AI assistant before or after dictating.
