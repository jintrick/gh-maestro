<WorkflowHero />

Wake up to ready-to-review repository improvements — automated triage, CI insights, docs updates, and test enhancements from simple markdown workflows.

GitHub Agentic Workflows deliver this: repository automation, running the coding agents you know and love, in GitHub Actions, with strong guardrails and security-first design principles.

Use GitHub Copilot, Claude by Anthropic, Gemini from Google or OpenAI Codex for event-triggered and scheduled jobs to improve your repository. GitHub Agentic Workflows [augment](https://github.github.com/gh-aw/reference/faq/#determinism) your existing, deterministic CI/CD with [Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai) capabilities.

Developed by GitHub and Microsoft, workflows run with added guardrails, using safe outputs and sandboxed execution to help keep your repository safe.

> ⓘ Note: GitHub Agentic Workflows is in Public Preview and may change significantly.

## Guardrails Built-In

AI agents can be manipulated by prompt injection, malicious repository content, or compromised tools. GitHub Agentic Workflows uses layered controls to keep each run contained: sandboxing limits where code can execute, scoped permissions limit what it can request, and gated outputs ensure only approved actions reach GitHub.

    INPUT["Repository + Prompt Input"] --> TOKENS["Read-only Token"]

<FeatureGrid columns={3}>
  <FeatureCard title="Read-only token">
    The agent can read repository state, but it cannot
    push commits or write to issues directly.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="No secrets in agent runtime">
    Sensitive credentials stay in isolated downstream
    jobs, not inside the agent process.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Sandbox + network firewall" href="/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/#agent-workflow-firewall-awf">
    The agent runs in a container behind the Agent Workflow Firewall
    and can only reach allowed destinations.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Safe outputs gate" href="/gh-aw/reference/safe-outputs/">
    Requested actions are validated against your configured safe outputs
    policy before anything is applied.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Threat detection" href="/gh-aw/reference/threat-detection/">
    A dedicated threat detection job scans proposed outputs and blocks
    suspicious changes.
  </FeatureCard>
  <FeatureCard title="Compile-time validation" href="/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/#compilation-time-security">
    Schema validation, expression allowlisting, action pinning, and security
    scanners reject misconfigurations before deployment.
  </FeatureCard>
</FeatureGrid>

See the [Security Architecture](/gh-aw/introduction/architecture/) for a full breakdown of the layered defense-in-depth model.

## Manage Cost and Capacity

Cost control starts with visibility. Use `gh aw logs` and `gh aw audit` to find runs consuming the most time, tokens, and AI Credits (AIC), then tighten prompts, triggers, and model choices before spend drifts upward.

`max-ai-credits` gives each run a hard budget, while [OpenTelemetry](/gh-aw/guides/open-telemetry/) exports traces and token data to OTLP backends for dashboards, alerting, and cost analysis. For optimization over time, compare cost with [outcomes](/gh-aw/reference/outcomes/) so lower spend still produces useful accepted results.

## Example: Daily Issues Report

Here's a simple workflow that runs daily to create an upbeat status report:

```markdown
---
on:
  schedule: daily

permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: read
  pull-requests: read

safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    title-prefix: "[team-status] "
    labels: [report, daily-status]
    close-older-issues: true
---

## Daily Issues Report

Create an upbeat daily status report for the team as a GitHub issue.

## What to include

- Recent repository activity (issues, PRs, discussions, releases, code changes)
- Progress tracking, goal reminders and highlights
- Project status and recommendations
- Actionable next steps for maintainers

```

The `gh aw` cli hardens this to a traditional GitHub Actions Workflow (.lock.yml) that runs an AI coding agent (Copilot CLI, Claude Code, Codex, ...) in a containerized environment on a schedule or manually. The AI coding agent reads your repository context, analyzes issues, generates visualizations, and creates reports. All defined in natural language rather than complex code.
